abstract = {We develop, investigate, and compare two logic-based knowledge representation formalisms for reasoning about coalitional games. The main constructs of Coalitional Game Logic (cgl) are expressions for representing the ability of coalitions, which may be combined with expressions for representing the preferences that agents have over outcomes. Modal Coalitional Game Logic (mcgl) is a normal modal logic, in which the main construct is a modality for expressing the preferences of groups of agents. For both frameworks, we give complete axiomatisations, and show how they can be used to characterise solution concepts for coalitional games. We show that, while cgl is more expressive than mcgl, the former can only be used to reason about coalitional games with finitely many outcomes, while mcgl can be used to reason also about games with infinitely many outcomes, and is in addition more succinct. We characterise the computational complexity of satisfiability for cgl, and give a tableaux-based decision procedure. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society. Frequently cited examples include the cell, a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions, and the Internet, a network of routers and computers connected by physical links. While traditionally these systems have been modeled as random graphs, it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real networks are governed by robust organizing principles. This article reviews the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks, and the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.},

@article{Altomare2014,
abstract = {The application of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to model the three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction for waves approaching a rubble mound breakwater is presented. The main aim is to model the armoured structure and to validate its response under the action of periodic waves. The complex geometry is represented by grooved cubic blocks such that the surrounding gaps within the breakwater seaward layer require a large number of particles to obtain a sufficiently detailed description of the flow. Using novel computer architecture solutions such as graphics processing units (GPUs), the fluid-structure interaction is modelled with SPH particles between armour blocks that are representative of the real structure. The open-source GPU code, DualSPHysics, enables the simulation of millions of particles required for the accurate simulation of the run-up on an armoured structure. SPH has been proven to be a suitable method for practical applications in coastal engineering. In the present work the run-up heights are computed and compared with empirical solutions and experimental data. Reasonable agreement is obtained for the run-up due to regular waves over a range of surf similarity numbers from 3.0 to 5.5. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We review the current state of data mining and machine learning in astronomy. 'Data Mining' can have a somewhat mixed connotation from the point of view of a researcher in this field. If used correctly, it can be a powerful approach, holding the potential to fully exploit the exponentially increasing amount of available data, promising great scientific advance. However, if misused, it can be little more than the black-box application of complex computing algorithms that may give little physical insight, and provide questionable results. Here, we give an overview of the entire data mining process, from data collection through to the interpretation of results. We cover common machine learning algorithms, such as artificial neural networks and support vector machines, applications from a broad range of astronomy, emphasizing those where data mining techniques directly resulted in improved science, and important current and future directions, including probability density functions, parallel algorithms, petascale computing, and the time domain. We conclude that, so long as one carefully selects an appropriate algorithm, and is guided by the astronomical problem at hand, data mining can be very much the powerful tool, and not the questionable black box.},

Because Bayesian statistical methods can be applied to any data, regardless of the type of cognitive model (Bayesian or otherwise) that motivated the data collection, Bayesian methods for data analysis will continue to be appropriate even if Bayesian models of mind lose their appeal.},

abstract = {This article is about defining a suitable logic for expressing classical game theoretical notions. We define an extension of alternating-time temporal logic (ATL) that enables us to express various rationality assumptions of intelligent agents. Our proposal, the logic ATLP (ATLwith plausibility) allows us to specify sets of rational strategy profiles in the object language, and reason about agents' play if only these strategy profiles were allowed. For example, we may assume the agents to play only Nash equilibria, Pareto-optimal profiles or undominated strategies, and ask about the resulting behaviour (and outcomes) under such an assumption. The logic also gives rise to generalized versions of classical solution concepts through characterizing patterns of payoffs by suitably parameterized formulae of ATLP. We investigate the complexity of model checking ATLP for several classes of formulae: It ranges from \$\backslash Delta\_\{\backslash mathbf\{3\}\}\^{}\{\backslash mathbf\{P\}\}\$ to PSPACE in the general case and from \$\backslash Delta\_\{\backslash mathbf\{3\}\}\^{}\{\backslash mathbf\{P\}\}\$ to \$\backslash Delta\_\{\backslash mathbf\{4\}\}\^{}\{\backslash mathbf\{P\}\}\$ for the most interesting subclasses, and roughly corresponds to solving extensive games with imperfect information.},

abstract = {Many of the existing molecular simulation tools require the efficient identification of the set of nonbonded interacting atoms. This is necessary, for instance, to compute the energy values or the steric contacts between atoms. Cell linked-lists can be used to determine the pairs of atoms closer than a given cutoff distance in asymptotically optimal time. Despite this long-term optimality, many spurious distances are anyway computed with this method. Therefore, several improvements have been proposed, most of them aiming to refine the volume of influence for each atom. Here, we suggest a different improvement strategy based on avoiding to fill cells with those atoms that are always at a constant distance of a given atom. This technique is particularly effective when large groups of the particles in the simulation behave as rigid bodies as it is the case in simplified models considering only few of the degrees of freedom of the molecule. In these cases, the proposed technique can reduce the number of distance computations by more than one order of magnitude, as compared with the standard cell linked-list technique. The benefits of this technique are obtained without incurring in additional computation costs, because it carries out the same operations as the standard cell linked-list algorithm, although in a different order. Since the focus of the technique is the order of the operations, it might be combined with existing improvements based on bounding the volume of influence for each atom.},

abstract = {A century ago, in 1911 and 1913, Plummer and then Reynolds introduced their models to describe the radial distribution of stars in `nebulae'. This article reviews the progress since then, providing both an historical perspective and a contemporary review of the stellar structure of bulges, discs and elliptical galaxies. The quantification of galaxy nuclei, such as central mass deficits and excess nuclear light, plus the structure of dark matter halos and cD galaxy envelopes, are discussed. Issues pertaining to spiral galaxies including dust, bulge-to-disc ratios, bulgeless galaxies, bars and the identification of pseudobulges are also reviewed. An array of modern scaling relations involving sizes, luminosities, surface brightnesses and stellar concentrations are presented, many of which are shown to be curved. These 'redshift zero' relations not only quantify the behavior and nature of galaxies in the Universe today, but are the modern benchmark for evolutionary studies of galaxies, whether based on observations, N-body-simulations or semi-analytical modelling. For example, it is shown that some of the recently discovered compact elliptical galaxies at 1.5 < z < 2.5 may be the bulges of modern disc galaxies.},

abstract = {Raytracing dynamic scenes at interactive rates have received a lot of attention recently. We present a few strategies for high performance raytracing on a commodity GPU. The construction of grids needs sorting, which is fast on today's GPUs. The grid is thus the acceleration structure of choice for dynamic scenes as per-frame rebuilding is required. We advocate the use of appropriate data structures for each stage of raytracing, resulting in multiple structure building per frame. A perspective grid built for the camera achieves perfect coherence for primary rays. A perspective grid built with respect to each light source provides the best performance for shadow rays. Spherical grids handle lights positioned inside the model space and handle spotlights. Uniform grids are best for reflection and refraction rays with little coherence. We propose an Enforced Coherence method to bring coherence to them by rearranging the ray to voxel mapping using sorting. This gives the best performance on GPUs with only user-managed caches. We also propose a simple, Independent Voxel Walk method, which performs best by taking advantage of the L1 and L2 caches on recent GPUs. We achieve over 10 fps of total rendering on the Conference model with one light source and one reflection bounce, while rebuilding the data structure for each stage. Ideas presented here are likely to give high performance on the future GPUs as well as other manycore architectures.},

abstract = {We present SEREN, a new hybrid Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and N-body code designed to simulate astrophysical processes such as star and planet formation. It is written in Fortran 95/2003 and has been parallelised using OpenMP. SEREN is designed in a flexible, modular style, thereby allowing a large number of options to be selected or disabled easily and without compromising performance. SEREN uses the conservative `grad-h' formulation of SPH, but can easily be configured to use traditional SPH or Godunov SPH. Thermal physics is treated either with a barotropic equation of state, or by solving the energy equation and modelling the transport of cooling radiation. A Barnes-Hut tree is used to obtain neighbour lists and compute gravitational accelerations efficiently, and an hierarchical time-stepping scheme is used to reduce the number of computations per timestep. Dense gravitationally bound objects are replaced by sink particles, to allow the simulation to be evolved longer, and to facilitate the identification of protostars and the compilation of stellar and binary properties. At the termination of a hydrodynamical simulation, SEREN has the option of switching to a pure N-body simulation, using a 4th-order Hermite integrator, and following the ballistic evolution of the sink particles (e.g. to determine the final binary statistics once a star cluster has relaxed). We describe in detail all the algorithms implemented in SEREN and we present the results of a suite of tests designed to demonstrate the fidelity of SEREN and its performance and scalability. Further information and additional tests of SEREN can be found at the web-page http://www.astro.group.shef.ac.uk/seren.},

abstract = {Machine learning techniques are utilised in several areas of astrophysical research today. This dissertation addresses the application of ML techniques to two classes of problems in astrophysics, namely, the analysis of individual astronomical phenomena over time and the automated, simultaneous analysis of thousands of objects in large optical sky surveys. Specifically investigated are (1) techniques to approximate the precise orbits of the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn given Earth-based observations as well as (2) techniques to quickly estimate the distances of quasars observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Learning methods considered include genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimisation, artificial neural networks, and radial basis function networks.   The first part of this dissertation demonstrates that GAs and PSO can both be efficiently used to model functions that are highly non-linear in several dimensions. It is subsequently demonstrated in the second part that ANNs and RBFNs can be used as effective predictors of spectroscopic redshift given accurate photometry, especially in combination with other learning-based approaches described in the literature. Careful application of these and other ML techniques to problems in astronomy and astrophysics will contribute to a better understanding of stellar evolution, binary star systems, cosmology, and the large-scale structure of the universe.},

abstract = {For more than half a century, data analysts have used graphs to represent statistical models. In particular, graphical "conditional independence" models have emerged as a useful class of models. Applications of such models to probabilistic expert systems, image analysis, and pedigree analysis have motivated much of this work, and several expository texts are now available. Rather less well known is the development of a Bayesian framework for such models. Expert system applications have motivated this work, where the promise of a model that can update itself as data become available, has generated intense interest from the artificial intelligence community. However, the application to a broader range of data problems has been largely overlooked. The purpose of this article is to show how Bayesian graphical models unify and simplify many standard discrete data problems such as Bayesian log linear modelling with either complete or incomplete data, closed population estimation, and double sampling. Since conventional model selection fails in these applications, we construct posterior distributions for quantities of interest by averaging across models. Specifically we introduce Markov chain Monte Carlo model composition, a Monte Carlo method for Bayesian model averaging.},

@article{montgomery2010accretion,
abstract = {In Montgomery (2009a), we show that accretion discs in binary systems could retrogradely precess by tidal torques like the Moon and the Sun on a tilted, spinning, non-spherical Earth. In addition, we show that the state of matter and the geometrical shape of the celestial object could significantly affect the precessional value. For example, a Cataclysmic Variable (CV) Dwarf Novae (DN) non-magnetic system that shows negative superhumps in its light curve can be described by a retrogradely precessing, differentially rotating, tilted disc. Because the disc is a fluid and because the gas stream overflows the tilted disc and particles can migrate into inner disc annuli, coupled to the disc could be a retrogradely precessing inner ring that is located near the innermost annuli of the disc. However, numerical simulations by Bisikalo et al. (2003, 2004) and this work show that an inner spiral density wave can be generated instead of an inner ring. Therefore, we show that retrograde precession in non-magnetic, spinning, tilted CV DN systems can equally be described by a retrogradely precessing and differentially rotating disc with an attached retrogradely precessing inner spiral density wave so long as the wave appears at the same radius as the ring and within the plane of the tilted disc. We find that the theoretical results generated in this work agree well with the theoretical results presented in Montgomery (2009a) and thus with the numerical simulations and select CV DN systems in Montgomery (2009b) that may have a main sequence secondary. Therefore, pressure effects do need to be considered in CV DN systems that exhibit negative superhumps if the accretion discs are tilted and have an inner spiral density wave that is in the plane of the disc.},

@article{muller2004interactive,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose an interactive method based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate blood as a fluid with free surfaces. While SPH was originally designed to simulate astronomical objects, we gear the method towards fluid simulation by deriving the force density fields directly from the Navier-Stokes equation and by adding a term to model surface tension effects. In contrast to Eulerian grid-based approaches, the particle-based approach makes mass conservation equations and convection terms dispensable which reduces the complexity of the simulation. In addition, the particles can directly be used to render the surface of the fluid. Our method can be used in interactive surgical training systems with models of up to 3000 particles.},

abstract = {We present GRADSPMHD, a completely Lagrangian parallel magnetohydrodynamics code based on the SPH formalism. The implementation of the equations of SPMHD in the "GRAD-h" formalism assembles known results, including the derivation of the discretized MHD equations from a variational principle, the inclusion of time-dependent artificial viscosity, resistivity and conductivity terms, as well as the inclusion of a mixed hyperbolic/parabolic correction scheme for satisfying the x??B??? constraint on the magnetic field. The code uses a tree-based formalism for neighbor finding and can optionally use the tree code for computing the self-gravity of the plasma. The structure of the code closely follows the framework of our parallel GRADSPH FORTRAN 90 code which we added previously to the CPC program library. We demonstrate the capabilities of GRADSPMHD by running 1, 2, and 3 dimensional standard benchmark tests and we find good agreement with previous work done by other researchers. The code is also applied to the problem of simulating the magnetorotational instability in 2.5D shearing box tests as well as in global simulations of magnetized accretion disks. We find good agreement with available results on this subject in the literature. Finally, we discuss the performance of the code on a parallel supercomputer with distributed memory architecture. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We describe the algorithms implemented in the first version of GRADSPH, a parallel, tree-based, smoothed particle hydrodynamics code for simulating self-gravitating astrophysical systems written in FORTRAN 90. The paper presents details on the implementation of the Smoothed Particle Hydro (SPH) description, where a gridless approach is used to model compressible gas dynamics. This is done in the conventional SPH way by means of 'particles' which sample fluid properties, exploiting interpolating kernels. The equations of self-gravitating hydrodynamics in the SPH framework are derived self-consistently from a Lagrangian and account for variable smoothing lengths ('GRAD-h') terms in both the hydrodynamic and gravitational acceleration equations. A Barnes-Hut tree is used for treating self-gravity and updating the neighbour list of the particles. In addition, the code updates particle properties on their own individual timesteps and uses a basic parallelisation strategy to speed up calculations on a parallel computer system with distributed memory architecture. Extensive tests of the code in one and three dimensions are presented. Finally, we describe the program organisation of the publicly available 3D version of the code, as well as details concerning the structure of the input and output files and the execution of the program.

abstract = {In recent years a handful of systems have been observed to show "negative" (nodal) superhumps, with periods slightly shorter than the orbital period. It has been suggested that these modes are a consequence of the slow retrograde precession of the line of nodes in a disk tilted with respect to the orbital plane. Our simulations confirm and refine this model: they suggest a roughly axisymmetric, retrogradely-precessing, tilted disk that is driven at a period slightly less than half the orbital period as the tidal field of the orbiting secondary encounters in turn the two halves of the disk above and below the midplane. Each of these passings leads to viscous dissipation on one face of an optically-thick disk -- observers on opposite sides of the disk would each observe one brightening per orbit, but 180 degrees out of phase with each other.},

abstract = {Negative superhumps in cataclysmic variable systems result when the accretion disc is tilted with respect to the orbital plane. The line of nodes of the tilted disc precesses slowly in the retrograde direction, resulting in a photometric signal with a period slightly less than the orbital period. We use the method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics to simulate a series of models of differing mass ratio and effective viscosity to determine the retrograde precession period and superhump period deficit \$\backslash varepsilon\_-\$ as a function of system mass ratio \$q\$. We tabulate our results and present fits to both \$\backslash varepsilon\_-\$ and \$\backslash varepsilon\_+\$ versus \$q\$, as well as compare the numerical results with those compiled from the literature of negative superhump observations. One surprising is that while we find negative superhumps most clearly in simulations with an accretion stream present, we also find evidence for negative superhumps in simulations in which we shut off the mass transfer stream completely, indicating that the origin of the photometric signal is more complicated than previously believed.},

abstract = {We study the problem of computing conditional probabilities, a fundamental operation in statistics and machine learning. In the elementary discrete setting, a ratio of probabilities defines conditional probability. In the abstract setting, conditional probability is defined axiomatically and the search for more constructive definitions is the subject of a rich literature in probability theory and statistics. In the discrete or dominated setting, under suitable computability hypotheses, conditional probabilities are computable. However, we show that in general one cannot compute conditional probabilities. We do this by constructing a pair of computable random variables in the unit interval whose conditional distribution encodes the halting problem at almost every point. We show that this result is tight, in the sense that given an oracle for the halting problem, one can compute this conditional distribution. On the other hand, we show that conditioning in abstract settings is computable in the presence of certain additional structure, such as independent absolutely continuous noise.},

abstract = {This paper will address the ability of recent technological advances in Virtual Worlds (VWs) to affect better submarine C2 design via increased participation by the fleet personnel in design and experimentation. With the rapid emergence and evolution of VWs over the past three years, the US Navy has investigated and applied multiple applications of this technology to the undersea warfare (USW) domain. One area of application that is currently being supported is C2 collaborative engineering and concept of operation exercises (COOPEXs). VWs enable all stakeholders to remotely, distributively, and collaboratively participate in the design of prototype systems in real time while utilizing video, voice, chat, and intuitive build tools. These prototypes can then be used to analyze pre-recorded C2 events for the purpose of exposing information flow through a C2 space and visualization of C2 metrics. In addition, VWs allow these virtual prototypes to be evaluated by fleet personnel immersed into the environment with enough fidelity to allow operator performance assessment. This is because VWs allow for live connections with full control to real-world tactical systems. These capabilities are currently being utilized by multiple USW programs for next generation submarine attack center design.},

abstract = {We propose timed (finite) automata to model the behavior of real-time systems over time. Our definition provides a simple, and yet powerful, way to annotate state-transition graphs with timing constraints using finitely many real-valued clocks. A timed automaton accepts timed words–infinite sequences in which a real-valued time of occurrence is associated with each symbol. We study timed automata from the perspective of formal language theory: we consider closure properties, decision problems, and subclasses. We consider both nondeterministic and deterministic transition structures, and both B\"{u}chi and Muller acceptance conditions. We show that nondeterministic timed automata are closed under union and intersection, but not under complementation, whereas deterministic timed Muller automata are closed under all Boolean operations. The main construction of the paper is an (PSPACE) algorithm for checking the emptiness of the language of a (nondeterministic) timed automaton. We also prove that the universality problem and the language inclusion problem are solvable only for the deterministic automata: both problems are undecidable ($\Pi$11-hard) in the nondeterministic case and PSPACE-complete in the deterministic case. Finally, we discuss the application of this theory to automatic verification of real-time requirements of finite-state systems.},

abstract = {Fast determination of neighboring atoms is an essential step in molecular dynamics simulations or Monte Carlo computations, and there exists a variety of algorithms to efficiently compute neighbor lists. However, most of these algorithms are general, and not specifically designed for a given type of application. As a result, although their average performance is satisfactory, they might be inappropriate in some specific application domains. In this article, we study the case of detecting neighbors between large rigid molecules, which has applications in, e.g., rigid body molecular docking, Monte Carlo simulations of molecular self-assembly or diffusion, and rigid body molecular dynamics simulations. More precisely, we compare the traditional grid-based algorithm to a series of hierarchy-based algorithms that use bounding volumes to rapidly eliminate large groups of irrelevant pairs of atoms during the neighbor search. We compare the performance of these algorithms based on several parameters: the size of the molecules, the average distance between them, the cutoff distance, as well as the type of bounding volume used in the culling hierarchy (AABB, OBB, wrapped, or layered spheres). We demonstrate that for relatively large systems (> 100,000 atoms) the algorithm based on the hierarchy of wrapped spheres shows the best results and the traditional grid-based algorithm gives the worst timings. For small systems, however, the grid-based algorithm and the one based on the wrapped sphere hierarchy are beneficial.},

abstract = {We propose a new and simple technique called the Symmetric Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SSPH) method to construct basis functions for meshless methods that use only locations of particles. These basis functions are found to be similar to those in the Finite Element Method (FEM) except that the basis for the derivatives of a function need not be obtained by differentiating those for the function. Of course, the basis for the derivatives of a function can be obtained by differentiating the basis for the function as in the FEM and meshless methods. These basis functions are used to numerically solve two plane stress/strain elasto-static problems by using either the collocation method or a weak formulation of the problem defined over a subregion of the region occupied by the body; the latter is usually called the Meshless Local Petrov–Galerkin (MLPG) method. For the two boundary-value problems studied, it is found that the weak formulation in which the basis for the first order derivatives of the trial solution are derived directly in the SSPH method (i.e., not obtained by differentiating the basis function for the trial solution) gives the least value of the L2-error norm in the displacements while the collocation method employing the strong formulation of the boundary-value problem has the largest value of the L2-error norm. The numerical solution using the weak formulation requires more CPU time than the solution with the strong formulation of the problem. We have also computed the L2-error norm of displacements by varying the number of particles, the number of Gauss points used to numerically evaluate domain integrals appearing in the weak formulation of the problem, the radius of the compact support of the kernel function used to generate the SSPH basis, the order of complete monomials employed for constructing the SSPH basis, and boundary conditions used at a point on a corner of the rectangular problem domain. It is recommended that for solving two-dimensional elasto-static problems, the MLPG formulation in which derivatives of the trial solution are found without differentiating the SSPH basis function be adopted.},

abstract = {We present an implementation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with improved ac-curacy for simulations of galaxies and the large-scale structure. In particular, we combine, implement, modify and test a vast majority of SPH improvement techniques in the latest in-stalment of the GADGET code. We use the Wendland kernel functions, a particle wake-up time-step limiting mechanism and a time-dependent scheme for artificial viscosity, which in-cludes a high-order gradient computation and shear flow limiter. Additionally, we include a novel prescription for time-dependent artificial conduction, which corrects for gravitationally induced pressure gradients and largely improves the SPH performance in capturing the devel-opment of gas-dynamical instabilities. We extensively test our new implementation in a wide range of hydrodynamical standard tests including weak and strong shocks as well as shear flows, turbulent spectra, gas mixing, hydrostatic equilibria and self-gravitating gas clouds. We jointly employ all modifications; however, when necessary we study the performance of individual code modules. We approx-imate hydrodynamical states more accurately and with significantly less noise than standard SPH. Furthermore, the new implementation promotes the mixing of entropy between different fluid phases, also within cosmological simulations. Finally, we study the performance of the hydrodynamical solver in the context of radia-tive galaxy formation and non-radiative galaxy cluster formation. We find galactic disks to be colder, thinner and more extended and our results on galaxy clusters show entropy cores instead of steadily declining entropy profiles. In summary, we demonstrate that our improved SPH implementation overcomes most of the undesirable limitations of standard SPH, thus becoming the core of an efficient code for large cosmological simulations.},

abstract = {Violent free surface flows exist in a number of physical processes related to marine engineering. Traditionally, these are simulated using mesh-based methods formulated in an Eulerian frame of reference. Lagrangian meshless and particle-based methods, like Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), represent an interesting alternative as they circumvent several common problems related to the free surface. This work is devoted to the properties and implementation of an SPH method based on pressure projection for incompressible inviscid flows with free surfaces. Novel features include a time integration scheme designed to improve stability, and a new treatment of the free surface pressure boundary condition. The mechanisms and performance of the algorithm are addressed with a study of the evolution of an elliptical drop, and the more practical problems of rigid body water entry and internal tank sloshing. The results are compared to those of competing methods. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Data volumes from multiple sky surveys have grown from gigabytes into terabytes during the past decade, and will grow from terabytes into tens (or hundreds) of petabytes in the next decade. This exponential growth of new data both enables and challenges effective astronomical research, requiring new approaches. Thus far, astronomy has tended to address these challenges in an informal and ad hoc manner, with the necessary special expertise being assigned to e-Science or survey science. However, we see an even wider scope and therefore promote a broader vision of this data-driven revolution in astronomical research. For astronomy to effectively cope with and reap the maximum scientific return from existing and future large sky surveys, facilities, and data-producing projects, we need our own information science specialists. We therefore recommend the formal creation, recognition, and support of a major new discipline, which we call Astroinformatics. Astroinformatics includes a set of naturally-related specialties including data organization, data description, astronomical classification taxonomies, astronomical concept ontologies, data mining, machine learning, visualization, and astrostatistics. By virtue of its new stature, we propose that astronomy now needs to integrate Astroinformatics as a formal sub-discipline within agency funding plans, university departments, research programs, graduate training, and undergraduate education. Now is the time for the recognition of Astroinformatics as an essential methodology of astronomical research. The future of astronomy depends on it.},

abstract = {The growth of data volumes in science is reaching epidemic proportions. Consequently, the status of data-oriented science as a research methodology needs to be elevated to that of the more established scientific approaches of experimentation, theoretical modeling, and simulation. Data-oriented scientific discovery is sometimes referred to as the new science of X-Informatics, where X refers to any science (e. g., Bio-, Geo-, Astro-) and informatics refers to the discipline of organizing, describing, accessing, integrating, mining, and analyzing diverse data resources for scientific discovery. Many scientific disciplines are developing formal sub-disciplines that are information-rich and data-based, to such an extent that these are now stand-alone research and academic programs recognized on their own merits. These disciplines include bioinformatics and geoinformatics, and will soon include astroinformatics. We introduce Astroinformatics, the new data-oriented approach to 21st century astronomy research and education. In astronomy, petascale sky surveys will soon challenge our traditional research approaches and will radically transform how we train the next generation of astronomers, whose experiences with data are now increasingly more virtual (through online databases) than physical (through trips to mountaintop observatories). We describe Astroinformatics as a rigorous approach to these challenges. We also describe initiatives in science education (not only in astronomy) through which students are trained to access large distributed data repositories, to conduct meaningful scientific inquiries into the data, to mine and analyze the data, and to make data-driven scientific discoveries. These are essential skills for all 21st century scientists, particularly in astronomy as major new multi-wavelength sky surveys (that produce petascale databases and image archives) and grand-scale simulations (that generate enormous outputs for model universes, such as the Millennium Simulation) become core research components for a significant fraction of astronomical researchers.},

abstract = {A century ago, in 1911 and 1913, Plummer and then Reynolds introduced their models to describe the radial distribution of stars in `nebulae'. This article reviews the progress since then, providing both an historical perspective and a contemporary review of the stellar structure of bulges, discs and elliptical galaxies. The quantification of galaxy nuclei, such as central mass deficits and excess nuclear light, plus the structure of dark matter halos and cD galaxy envelopes, are discussed. Issues pertaining to spiral galaxies including dust, bulge-to-disc ratios, bulgeless galaxies, bars and the identification of pseudobulges are also reviewed. An array of modern scaling relations involving sizes, luminosities, surface brightnesses and stellar concentrations are presented, many of which are shown to be curved. These 'redshift zero' relations not only quantify the behavior and nature of galaxies in the Universe today, but are the modern benchmark for evolutionary studies of galaxies, whether based on observations, N-body-simulations or semi-analytical modelling. For example, it is shown that some of the recently discovered compact elliptical galaxies at 1.5 < z < 2.5 may be the bulges of modern disc galaxies.},

By applying the laws of physics, you can realistically model nearly everything in games that bounces around, flies, rolls, slides, or isn't sitting still, to create compelling, believable content for computer games, simulations, and animation. "Physics for Game Developers" serves as the starting point for those who want to enrich games with physics-based realism. Part one is a mechanics primer that reviews basic concepts and addresses aspects of rigid body dynamics, including kinematics, force, and kinetics. Part two applies these concepts to specific real-world problems, such as projectiles, boats, airplanes, and cars. Part three introduces real-time simulations and shows how they apply to computer games. Many specific game elements stand to benefit from the use of real physics, including: The trajectory of rockets and missiles, including the effects of fuel burn off The collision of objects such as billiard balls The stability of cars racing around tight curves The dynamics of boats and other waterborne vehicles The flight path of a baseball after being struck by a bat The flight characteristics of airplanes You don't need to be a physics expert to learn from "Physics for Game Developers," but the author does assume you know basic college-level classical physics. You should also be proficient in trigonometry, vector and matrix math (reference formulas and identities are included in the appendixes), and college-level calculus, including integration and differentiation of explicit functions.

abstract = {Statistics and Statistics and Computing/Statistics ProgramsAbout this book -Provides guidance on getting data into R from text files, web pages, spreadsheets, databases and other sources. -Demonstrates techniques that use core features of the R language, and are scalable and efficient. -Covers many built in functions along with selected packages from CRAN.Since its inception, R has become one of the preeminent programs for statistical computing and data analysis. The ready availability of the program, along with a wide variety of packages and the supportive R community make R an excellent choice for almost any kind of computing task related to statistics. However, many users, especially those with experience in other languages, do not take advantage of the full power of R. Because of the nature of R, solutions that make sense in other languages may not be very efficient in R. This book presents a wide array of methods applicable for reading data into R, and efficiently manipulating that data.In addition to the built-in functions, a number of readily available packages from CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network) are also covered. All of the methods presented take advantage of the core features of R: vectorization, efficient use of subscripting, and the proper use of the varied functions in R that are provided for common data management tasks.Most experienced R users discover that, especially when working with large data sets, it may be helpful to use other programs, notably databases, in conjunction with R. Accordingly, the use of databases in R is covered in detail, along with methods for extracting data from spreadsheets and datasets created by other programs. Character manipulation, while sometimes overlooked within R, is also covered in detail, allowing problems that are traditionally solved by scripting languages to be carried out entirely within R. For users with experience in other languages, guidelines for the effective use of programming constructs like loops are provided. Since many statistical modeling and graphics functions need their data presented in a data frame, techniques for converting the output of commonly used functions to data frames are provided throughout the book.Using a variety of examples based on data sets included with R, along with easily simulated data sets, the book is recommended to anyone using R who wishes to advance from simple examples to practical real-life data manipulation solutions.Phil Spector is Applications Manager of the Statistical Computing Facility and Adjunct Professor in the Department of Statistics at University of California, Berkeley.Table of contentsData in R.- Reading and writing data.- R and databases.- Dates.- Factors.- Subscripting.- Character manipulation.- Data aggregation.- Reshaping data.- Index. 48,10},

abstract = {This article is about defining a suitable logic for expressing classical game theoretical notions. We define an extension of alternating-time temporal logic (ATL) that enables us to express various rationality assumptions of intelligent agents. Our proposal, the logic ATLP (ATLwith plausibility) allows us to specify sets of rational strategy profiles in the object language, and reason about agents' play if only these strategy profiles were allowed. For example, we may assume the agents to play only Nash equilibria, Pareto-optimal profiles or undominated strategies, and ask about the resulting behaviour (and outcomes) under such an assumption. The logic also gives rise to generalized versions of classical solution concepts through characterizing patterns of payoffs by suitably parameterized formulae of ATLP. We investigate the complexity of model checking ATLP for several classes of formulae: It ranges from \$\backslash Delta\_\{\backslash mathbf\{3\}\}\^{}\{\backslash mathbf\{P\}\}\$ to PSPACE in the general case and from \$\backslash Delta\_\{\backslash mathbf\{3\}\}\^{}\{\backslash mathbf\{P\}\}\$ to \$\backslash Delta\_\{\backslash mathbf\{4\}\}\^{}\{\backslash mathbf\{P\}\}\$ for the most interesting subclasses, and roughly corresponds to solving extensive games with imperfect information.},

abstract = {Molecular (or DNA) computing is founded on the idea that, given enough strands of DNA, and using certain biological operations one use DNA molecules to simulate some classic computations efficiently. The original insight is due to Leonard Adleman (1994) who showed how DNA can be used to solve the Directed Hamiltonian Path (DHP) graph problem (see GRAPH THEORY). Then Richard Lipton (1995) showed how to use DNA to solve more general problems, namely to find satisfying assignments for arbitrary Boolean formulas (see BOOLEAN ALGEBRA). Lipton's approach shows that DNA can be used to solve a large class of combinatorial search problems. Since then there have been many new ideas on DNA computation. In this article we review some of these proposals.},

abstract = {In competitive human swimming the submerged dolphin kick stroke (underwater undulatory swimming) is utilized after dives and turns. The optimal dolphin kick has a balance between minimizing drag and maximizing thrust while also minimizing the physical exertion required of the swimmer. In this study laser scans of athletes are used to provide realistic swimmer geometries in a single anatomical pose. These are rigged and animated to closely match side-on video footage. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) fluid simulations are performed to evaluate variants of this swimming stroke technique. This computational approach provides full temporal and spatial information about the flow moving around the deforming swimmer model. The effects of changes in ankle flexibility and stroke frequency are investigated through a parametric study. The results suggest that the net streamwise force on the swimmer is relatively insensitive to ankle flexibility but is strongly dependent on kick frequency. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a numerical method commonly used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to simulate complex free-surface flows. Simulations with this mesh-free particle method far exceed the capacity of a single processor. In this paper, as part of a dual-functioning code for either central processing units (CPUs) or Graphics Processor Units (GPUs), a parallelisation using GPUs is presented. The GPU parallelisation technique uses the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) of nVidia devices. Simulations with more than one million particles on a single GPU card exhibit speedups of up to two orders of magnitude over using a single-core CPU. It is demonstrated that the code achieves different speedups with different CUDA-enabled GPUs. The numerical behaviour of the SPH code is validated with a standard benchmark test case of dam break flow impacting on an obstacle where good agreement with the experimental results is observed. Both the achieved speed-ups and the quantitative agreement with experiments suggest that CUDA-based GPU programming can be used in SPH methods with efficiency and reliability.},

abstract = {We present an overview of how the arterial fluid mechanics problems can be modeled with the stabilized space–time fluid–structure interaction (SSTFSI) technique developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM). The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

abstract = {A massively parallel SPH scheme using heterogeneous clusters of Central Processing Units (CPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) has been developed. The new implementation originates from the single-GPU DualSPHysics code previously demonstrated to be powerful, stable and accurate. A combination of different parallel programming languages is combined to exploit not only one device (CPU or GPU) but also the combination of different machines. Communication among devices uses an improved Message Passing Interface (MPI) implementation which addresses some of the well-known drawbacks of MPI such as including a dynamic load balancing and overlapping data communications and computation tasks. The efficiency and scalability (strong and weak scaling) obtained with the new DualSPHysics code are analysed for different numbers of particles and different number of GPUs. Last, an application with more than 109 particles is presented to show the capability of the code to handle simulations that otherwise require large CPU clusters or supercomputers. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Le domaine du Calcul \`{a} Haute Performance (HPC) \'{e}volue \'{e}troitement avec les derni\`{e}res avanc\'{e}es technologiques des architectures informatiques et des besoins toujours croissants en demande de puissance de calcul. Cette th\`{e}se s’int\'{e}resse \`{a} l’\'{e}tude d’un type d’intergiciel particulier appel\'{e} gestionnaire de t\^{a}ches et ressources (RJMS) qui est charg\'{e} de distribuer la puissance de calcul aux applications dans les plate-formes pour le HPC. Le RJMS joue un r\^{o}le central du fait de sa position dans la pile logicielle. Les derni\`{e}res \'{e}volutions dans les couches mat\'{e}rielles et dans les applications ont largement augment\'{e}s le niveau de complexit\'{e} auquel doit faire face ce type d’intergiciel. Des probl\'{e}matiques telles que le passage \`{a} l’\'{e}chelle, la prise en compte d’un taux d’activit\'{e} irr\'{e}gulier, la gestion des contraintes li\'{e}es \`{a} la topologie du mat\'{e}riel, l’efficacit\'{e} \'{e}nerg\'{e}tique et la tol\'{e}rance aux pannes doivent \^{e}tre particuli\`{e}rement pris en consid\'{e}ration, afin, entre autres, de fournir une meilleure exploitation des ressources \`{a} la fois du point de vue global du syst\`{e}me ainsi que de celui des utilisateurs. La premi\`{e}re contribution de cette th\`{e}se est un \'{e}tat de l’art sur la gestion des t\^{a}ches et des ressources ainsi qu’une analyse comparative des principaux intergiciels actuels et des diff\'{e}rentes probl\'{e}matiques de recherche associ\'{e}es. Une m\'{e}trique important pour \'{e}valuer l’apport d’un RJMS sur une plate-forme est le niveau d’utilisation de l’ensemble du syst\`{e}me. On constate parmi les traces d’activit\'{e} de plusieurs plate-formes qu’un grand nombre d’entre elles pr\'{e}sentent un taux d’utilisation significativement inf\'{e}rieure \`{a} une pleine utilisation. Ce constat est la principale motivation des autres contributions de cette th\`{e}se qui portent sur les m\'{e}thodes d’exploitations de ces p\'{e}riodes de sous-utilisation au profit de la gestion globale du syst\`{e}me ou des applications en court d’ex\'{e}cution. Plus particuli\`{e}rement cette th\`{e}se explore premi\`{e}rement, les moyens d’accro\^{\i}tre le taux de calculs utiles dans le contexte des grilles l\'{e}g\`{e}res en pr\'{e}sence d’une forte variabilit\'{e} de la disponibilit\'{e} des ressources de calcul. Deuxi\`{e}mement, nous avons \'{e}tudi\'{e} le cas des t\^{a}ches dynamiques et propos\'{e} diff\'{e}rentes techniques s’int\'{e}grant au RJMS OAR et troisi\`{e}mement nous \'{e}valu\'{e}s plusieurs modes d’exploitation des ressources en prenant en compte la consommation \'{e}nerg\'{e}tique. Finalement, les \'{e}valuations de cette th\`{e}se reposent sur une approche exp\'{e}rimentale pour laquelle nous avons propos\'{e}s des outils et une m\'{e}thodologie permettant d’am\'{e}liorer significativement la ma\^{\i}trise et la reproductibilit\'{e} d’exp\'{e}riences complexes propre \`{a} ce domaine d’\'{e}tude.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) implementation algorithm on GPUs. To compute a force on a particle, neighboring particles have to be searched. However, implementation of a neighboring particle search on GPUs is not straightforward. We developed a method that can search for neighboring particles on GPUs, which enabled us to implement the SPH simulation entirely on GPUs. Since all of the computation is done on GPUs and no CPU processing is needed, the proposed algorithm can exploit the massive computational power of GPUs. Consequently, the simulation speed is many times increased with the proposed method.},

This book provides a comprehensive picture of the formation of stars and planetary systems, from their beginnings in cold clouds of molecular gas to their emergence as new suns with planet-forming disks. At each stage gravity induces an inward accretion of mass, and this is a central theme for the book. The author brings together current observations, rigorous treatments of the relevant astrophysics, and 150 illustrations, to clarify the sequence of events in star and planet formation. It is a comprehensive account of the underlying physical processes of accretion for graduate students and researchers.},

Our thesis first compares OpenCL to the other similar libraries and then illustrates its use. For ray-tracing we selected two acceleration structures – the uniform grids and bounding volume hierarchies. We implement their construction and traversal in C++ and OpenCL. In the end of the thesis, we measure which of them and on what architecture performs better.},

abstract = {The Graphics Processing Units or simply GPUs have evolved into extremely powerful and flexible processors. This flexibility and power have allowed new concepts in general purpose computation to emerge. This paper presents a new architecture for physics engines focusing on the simulation of rigid bodies with some of its methods implemented on the GPU. Sending physics computation to the GPU enables the unloading of the required computations from the CPU, allowing it to process other tasks and optimizations. Another important reason for using the GPU is to allow physics engines to process a higher number of bodies in the simulation. It also presents an automatic process distribution scheme between CPU and GPU. The importance of the automatic distribution for physics simulation arises from the fact that, sometimes, the simulated scene characteristics may change during the simulation and by using an automatic distribution scheme the system may obtain the best performance of both processors (CPU and GPU). Also, with an automatic distribution mode, the developer does not have to decide which processor will do the work allowing the system to choose between CPU and GPU. This paper also presents an uncoupled multithread game loop used by the physics engine.},

abstract = {Big Data has gained much attention from the academia and the IT industry. In the digital and computing world, information is generated and collected at a rate that rapidly exceeds the boundary range. Currently, over 2 billion people worldwide are connected to the Internet, and over 5 billion individuals own mobile phones. By 2020, 50 billion devices are expected to be connected to the Internet. At this point, predicted data production will be 44 times greater than that in 2009. As information is transferred and shared at light speed on optic fiber and wireless networks, the volume of data and the speed of market growth increase. However, the fast growth rate of such large data generates numerous challenges, such as the rapid growth of data, transfer speed, diverse data, and security. Nonetheless, Big Data is still in its infancy stage, and the domain has not been reviewed in general. Hence, this study comprehensively surveys and classifies the various attributes of Big Data, including its nature, definitions, rapid growth rate, volume, management, analysis, and security. This study also proposes a data life cycle that uses the technologies and terminologies of Big Data. Future research directions in this field are determined based on opportunities and several open issues in Big Data domination. These research directions facilitate the exploration of the domain and the development of optimal techniques to address Big Data.},

Increasingly, new functions are being identified for axon guidance molecules in the dynamic processes that occur within the embryonic and adult nervous system. The magnitude, duration, and spatial activity of axon guidance molecule signaling are precisely regulated by a variety of molecular mechanisms. Here we focus on recent progress in understanding the role of protease-mediated cleavage of guidance factors required for directional axon growth, with a particular emphasis on the role of metalloprotease and $\gamma$-secretase. Since axon guidance molecules have also been linked to neural degeneration and regeneration in adults, studies of guidance receptor proteolysis are beginning to define new relationships between neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. These findings raise the possibility that the signaling checkpoints controlled by proteases could be useful targets to enhance regeneration.},

abstract = {Two algorithms of the SPH Lagrangian numerical method, the first weakly compressible, the second truly incompressible, are presented and applied to two free-surface three-dimensional flows. The first (schematic) case consists of a water column collapsing in a rectangular tank with a central rectangular obstacle, and allows the comparison and validation of both algorithms. It appears that the incompressible method is superior to predict the total strength experienced by the obstacle, while the weakly compressible method shows weaknesses under this criterion. The second application case, very close to an industrial study, represents a \^{a}€\oe ski-jump\^{a}€ spillway connecting the reservoir of a river dam to a valley with complex bottom shape. The global flow pattern is compared to laboratory observations from a physical model, leading to satisfactory conclusions which prove SPH has the potential to be a promising method for the design of complex waterworks.},

abstract = {Recently, with the increasing demand for photorealistic graphics and the rapid advances in desktop CPUs/GPUs, real-time ray tracing has attracted considerable attention. Unfortunately, ray tracing in the current mobile environment is very difficult because of inadequate computing power, memory bandwidth, and flexibility in mobile GPUs. In this paper, we present a novel mobile GPU architecture called SGRT (Samsung reconfigurable GPU based on Ray Tracing) in which a fast compact hardware accelerator and a flexible programmable shader are combined. SGRT has two key features: 1) an area-efficient parallel pipelined traversal unit; and 2) flexible and high-performance kernels for shading and ray generation. Simulation results show that SGRT is potentially a versatile graphics solution for future application processors as it provides a real-time ray tracing performance at full HD resolution that can compete with that of existing desktop GPU ray tracers. Our system is implemented on an FPGA platform, and mobile ray tracing is successfully demonstrated.},

abstract = {When considering a graphical Gaussian model \$\{\backslash mathcal\{N\}\}\_G\$ Markov with respect to a decomposable graph \$G\$, the parameter space of interest for the precision parameter is the cone \$P\_G\$ of positive definite matrices with fixed zeros corresponding to the missing edges of \$G\$. The parameter space for the scale parameter of \$\{\backslash mathcal\{N\}\}\_G\$ is the cone \$Q\_G\$, dual to \$P\_G\$, of incomplete matrices with submatrices corresponding to the cliques of \$G\$ being positive definite. In this paper we construct on the cones \$Q\_G\$ and \$P\_G\$ two families of Wishart distributions, namely the Type I and Type II Wisharts. They can be viewed as generalizations of the hyper Wishart and the inverse of the hyper inverse Wishart as defined by Dawid and Lauritzen [Ann. Statist. 21 (1993) 1272--1317]. We show that the Type I and II Wisharts have properties similar to those of the hyper and hyper inverse Wishart. Indeed, the inverse of the Type II Wishart forms a conjugate family of priors for the covariance parameter of the graphical Gaussian model and is strong directed hyper Markov for every direction given to the graph by a perfect order of its cliques, while the Type I Wishart is weak hyper Markov. Moreover, the inverse Type II Wishart as a conjugate family presents the advantage of having a multidimensional shape parameter, thus offering flexibility for the choice of a prior.},

The central issue in the theory of accretion disks is to identify the dominant mechanisms that regulate angular momentum transfer and mass flow in a variety of contexts. In the first part of this review, we described some recent advances in the study of the physical processes that may be present in accretion disks. Concurrent with these theoretical developments, the arrival of high-resolution astronomical instruments has led to explosive progress on the observational side. In many cases, the study of accretion disks has evolved from their inferred presence based on circumstantial evidence to direct imaging and detailed spectral analyses. Here, we summarize the theoretical interpretation of these data. We review the constraints that may be imposed on the efficiency and nature of angular momentum transfer processes in a variety of astrophysical contexts.},

The practice of our discipline will mature only when we can come to a basic agreement about how to apply statistics to real problems. Simple and more general illustrations are given of the negative consequences of the existing schism between frequentists and Bayesians. An assessment of strengths and weaknesses of the frequentist and Bayes systems of inference suggests that calibrated Bayes—a compromise based on the works of Box, Rubin, and others—captures the strengths of both approaches and provides a roadmap for future advances. The approach asserts that inferences under a particular model should be Bayesian, but model assessment can and should involve frequentist ideas. This article also discusses some implications of this proposed compromise for the teaching and practice of statistics. CR - Copyright \&\#169; 2006 American Statistical Association},

abstract = {Distributed virtual environments (DVEs) have been an active area of research and engineering for more than 20 years. The most widely deployed DVEs are network games such as Quake, Halo, and World of Warcraft (WoW), with millions of users and billions of dollars in annual revenue. Deployed DVEs remain expensive centralized implementations despite significant research outlining ways to distribute DVE workloads. This dissertation shows previous DVE research evaluations are inconsistent with deployed DVE needs. Assumptions about avatar movement and proximity - fundamental scale factors - do not match WoW’s workload, and likely the workload of other deployed DVEs. Alternate workload models are explored and preliminary conclusions presented. Using realistic workloads it is shown that a fully decentralized DVE cannot be deployed to today’s consumers, regardless of its overhead. Residential broadband speeds are improving, and this limitation will eventually disappear. When it does, appropriate security mechanisms will be a fundamental requirement for technology adoption. A trusted auditing system (“Carbon”) is presented which has good security, scalability, and resource characteristics for decentralized DVEs. When performing exhaustive auditing, Carbon adds 27\% network overhead to a decentralized DVE with a WoW-like workload. This resource consumption can be reduced significantly, depending upon the DVE’s risk tolerance. Finally, the Pairwise Random Protocol (PRP) is described. PRP enables adversaries to fairly resolve probabilistic activities, an ability missing from most decentralized DVE security proposals. Thus, this dissertations contribution is to address two of the obstacles for deploying research on decentralized DVE architectures. First, lack of evidence that research results apply to existing DVEs. Second, the lack of security systems combining appropriate security guarantees with acceptable overhead.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with approximating arbitrarily shaped boundaries in SPH simulations. We model the boundaries by means of boundary particles which exert forces on a fluid. We show that, when these forces are chosen correctly, and the boundary particle spacing is a factor of 2 (or more) less than the fluid particle spacing, the total boundary force on a fluid SPH particle is perpendicular to boundaries with negligible error. Furthermore, the variation in the force as a fluid particle moves, while keeping a fixed distance from the boundary, is also negligible. The method works equally well for convex or concave boundaries. The new boundary forces simplify SPH algorithms and are superior to other methods for simulating complicated boundaries. We apply the new method to (a) the rise of a cylinder contained in a curved basin, (b) the spin down of a fluid in a cylinder, and (c) the oscillation of a cylinder inside a larger fixed cylinder. The results of the simulations are in good agreement with those obtained using other methods, but with the advantage that they are very simple to implement. Crown Copyright ?? 2009.},

abstract = {The tensile instability in smoothed particle hydrodynamics results in a clustering of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) particles. The clustering is particularly noticeable in materials which have an equation of state which can give rise to negative pressures, but it can occur in gases where the pressure is always positive and in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems. It is a particular problem in solid body computations where the instability may corrupt physical fragmentation by numerical fragmentation which, in some cases, is so severe that the dynamics of the system is completely wrong. In this paper it is shown how the instability can be removed by using an artificial stress which, in the case of fluids, is an artificial pressure. The method is analyzed by examining the dispersion relation for small oscillations in a fluid with a stiff equation of state. The short and long wavelength limits of the dispersion relation indicate appropriate parameters for the artificial pressure and, with these parameters, the errors in the long wavelength limit are small. Numerical studies of the dispersion relation for a wide range of parameters confirm the approximate analytical results for the dispersion relation. Applications to several test problems show that the artificial stress works effectively. These problems include the evolution of a region with negative pressure, extreme expansion in one dimension, and the collision of rubber cylinders. To study this latter problem the artificial pressure is generalized to an artificial stress. The results agree well with the calculations of other stable codes.},

The method of discretising a continuous field into particles using a smoothing kernel is considered, and also the errors associated with this approach. A fully conservative form of SPH is then derived from the Lagrangian, demonstrating the explicit conservation of mass, linear and angular momenta and energy/entropy. The method is then extended to self-consistently include spatially varying smoothing lengths, (self) gravity and various forms of artificial viscosity, required for the correct treatment of shocks. Finally two common methods of time integration are discussed, the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg and leapfrog integrators, along with an overview of time-stepping criteria.},

abstract = {Using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, we numerically simulate steady state accretion discs for Cataclysmic Variable Dwarf Novae systems that have a secondary-to-primary mass ratio (0.35 $\backslash$le q $\backslash$le 0.55). After these accretion discs have come to quasi-equilibrium, we rotate each disc out of the orbital plane by ($\backslash$delta = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5,) or (20)\^{}\{o\}) to induce negative superhumps. For accretion discs tilted \$5\^{}\{o\}\$, we generate light curves and associated Fourier transforms for an atlas on negative superhumps and retrograde precession. Our simulation results suggest that accretion discs need to be tilted more than three degrees for negative superhumps to be statistically significant. We also show that if the disc is tilted enough such that the gas stream strikes a disc face, then a dense cooling ring is generated near the radius of impact. In addition to the atlas, we study these artificially tilted accretion discs to find the source to negative superhumps. Our results suggest that the source is additional light from innermost disc annuli, and this additional light waxes and wanes with the amount of gas stream overflow received as the secondary orbits. The nodes, where the gas stream transitions from flowing over to under the disc rim (and vice versa), precess in the retrograde direction.},

abstract = {Mergers of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs have long been suspected to be progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. Here we present our modifications to the cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics code GADGET to apply it to stellar physics including but not limited to mergers of white dwarfs. We demonstrate a new method to map a one-dimensional profile of an object in hydrostatic equilibrium to a stable particle distribution. We use the code to study the effect of initial conditions and resolution on the properties of the merger of two white dwarfs. We compare mergers with approximate and exact binary initial conditions and find that exact binary initial conditions lead to a much more stable binary system, but there is no difference in the properties of the actual merger. In contrast, we find that resolution is a critical issue for simulations of white dwarf mergers. Carbon burning hotspots which may lead to a detonation in the so-called violent merger scenario emerge only in simulations with sufficient resolution but independent of the type of binary initial conditions. We conclude that simulations of white dwarf mergers which attempt to investigate their potential for Type Ia supernovae should be carried out with at least 106 particles.},

Applying these considerations to the Navier-Stokes equations, a physical viscosity is constructed which can be used to perform simulations of viscous fluids within the framework of SPH. With such a viscous stress tensor the energy balance and the angular momentum conservation for the particle and the continuum representations are compared. An SPH code based on these results is tested on different problems, especially on an analytically solvable problem, namely the spreading of a ring of gas moving with Keplerian speed around a point mass. Additionally, some examples for the dynamics of accretion disks in close binary systems are presented. Finally, the efficient implementation of this SPH code is discussed in some detail, in particular by a comparison between scalar and vector computers.},

abstract = {The paper presents a detailed review of the smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method with particular focus on its astrophysical applications. We start by introducing the basic ideas and concepts and thereby outline all ingredients that are necessary for a practical implementation of the method in a working SPH code. Much of SPH's success relies on its excellent conservation properties and therefore the numerical conservation of physical invariants receives much attention throughout this review. The self-consistent derivation of the SPH equations from the Lagrangian of an ideal fluid is the common theme of the remainder of the text. We derive a modern, Newtonian SPH formulation from the Lagrangian of an ideal fluid. It accounts for changes of the local resolution lengths which result in corrective, so-called "grad-h-terms". We extend this strategy to special relativity for which we derive the corresponding grad-h equation set. The variational approach is further applied to a general-relativistic fluid evolving in a fixed, curved background space-time. Particular care is taken to explicitly derive all relevant equations in a coherent way. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The article highlights the problem of mathematical modelling and subsequent simulation of the highly complex synthetic environment illustrating the real production system consisting of parallel manufacturing plants equipped with interoperation buffer stores. The system can be arranged optionally by means of the simulator which was created on the basis of the presented assumptions in the C\# programming language. The discussed system realizes orders set by defined customers. Production control is based on heuristic algorithms which choose an order to be realized and a manufacturing plant in which the production process is carried out. The criterion is to minimize the total time of realizing orders however, as seen in the case study, also either the remaining capacity of tools after realizing all orders or the total tool replacement time can be taken into account while dealing with the problem. The modelling and projecting stages are followed by the simulation study. This simulation study is realized for the specific list of orders. It all leads to the thorough analysis of the obtained results which are later compared with the results obtained for the system without interoperation buffer stores. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.},

abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree'-method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different timesteps. Individual and adaptive short-range timesteps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelisation algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10\^{}10 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10\^{}5 per dimension in a 3D box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

abstract = {We describe the newly written code GADGET which is suitable both for cosmological simulations of structure formation and for the simulation of interacting galaxies. GADGET evolves self-gravitating collisionless fluids with the traditional N-body approach, and a collisional gas by smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Along with the serial version of the code, we discuss a parallel version that has been designed to run on massively parallel supercomputers with distributed memory. While both versions use a tree algorithm to compute gravitational forces, the serial version of GADGET can optionally employ the special-purpose hardware GRAPE instead of the tree. Periodic boundary conditions are supported by means of an Ewald summation technique. The code uses individual and adaptive timesteps for all particles, and it combines this with a scheme for dynamic tree updates. Due to its Lagrangian nature, GADGET thus allows a very large dynamic range to be bridged, both in space and time. So far, GADGET has been successfully used to run simulations with up to 7.5e7 particles, including cosmological studies of large-scale structure formation, high-resolution simulations of the formation of clusters of galaxies, as well as workstation-sized problems of interacting galaxies. In this study, we detail the numerical algorithms employed, and show various tests of the code. We publically release both the serial and the massively parallel version of the code.},

The method of discretising a continuous field into particles using a smoothing kernel is considered, and also the errors associated with this approach. A fully conservative form of SPH is then derived from the Lagrangian, demonstrating the explicit conservation of mass, linear and angular momenta and energy/entropy. The method is then extended to self-consistently include spatially varying smoothing lengths, (self) gravity and various forms of artificial viscosity, required for the correct treatment of shocks. Finally two common methods of time integration are discussed, the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg and leapfrog integrators, along with an overview of time-stepping criteria.},

In order to meet these challenges, and in order to open up new avenues for collaboration between users of multiple simulation platforms, we present yt (available at http://yt.enzotools.org/), an open source, community-developed astrophysical analysis and visualization toolkit. Analysis and visualization with yt are oriented around physically relevant quantities rather than quantities native to astrophysical simulation codes. While originally designed for handling Enzo's structure adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) data, yt has been extended to work with several different simulation methods and simulation codes including Orion, RAMSES, and FLASH. We report on its methods for reading, handling, and visualizing data, including projections, multivariate volume rendering, multi-dimensional histograms, halo finding, light cone generation and topologically-connected isocontour identification. Furthermore, we discuss the underlying algorithms yt uses for processing and visualizing data, and its mechanisms for parallelization of analysis tasks.},

abstract = {Starting from the single graphics processing unit (GPU) version of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code DualSPHysics, a multi-GPU SPH program is developed for free-surface flows. The approach is based on a spatial decomposition technique, whereby different portions (sub-domains) of the physical system under study are assigned to different GPUs. Communication between devices is achieved with the use of Message Passing Interface (MPI) application programming interface (API) routines. The use of the sorting algorithm radix sort for inter-GPU particle migration and sub-domain "halo" building (which enables interaction between SPH particles of different sub-domains) is described in detail. With the resulting scheme it is possible, on the one hand, to carry out simulations that could also be performed on a single GPU, but they can now be performed even faster than on one of these devices alone. On the other hand, accelerated simulations can be performed with up to 32 million particles on the current architecture, which is beyond the limitations of a single GPU due to memory constraints. A study of weak and strong scaling behaviour, speedups and efficiency of the resulting program is presented including an investigation to elucidate the computational bottlenecks. Last, possibilities for reduction of the effects of overhead on computational efficiency in future versions of our scheme are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{wood2006fitdisk,
abstract = {We present the software tool FITDisk, a precompiled-binary Windows GUI version of our smoothed particle hydrodynamics cataclysmic variable accretion disk research code. Cataclysmic variables are binary star systems in which a compact stellar remnant, typically a white dwarf star, is stripping mass from a lower-main-sequence companion star by way of an accretion disk. Typically the disk is the brightest component of the system, because the plasma is heated dramatically as it spirals down in the gravitational well of the primary white dwarf star. The shortest-period systems can display disk "superhump" oscillations driven by the rotating tidal field of the secondary star. FITDisk models these accretion disk phenomena using a fully three-dimensional hydrodynamics calculation, and data can be visualized as they are computed or stored to hard drive for later playback at a fast frame rate. Simulations are visualized using OpenGL graphics and the viewing angle can be changed interactively. Pseudo light curves of simulated systems can be plotted along with the associated Fourier amplitude spectrum. FITDisk is available for free download at www.astro.fit.edu/cv/fitdisk.html.},

abstract = {We report on the analysis of the Kepler short-cadence (SC) light curve of V344 Lyr obtained during 2009 June 20 through 2010 Mar 19 (Q2--Q4). The system is an SU UMa star showing dwarf nova outbursts and superoutbursts, and promises to be a touchstone for CV studies for the foreseeable future. The system displays both positive and negative superhumps with periods of 2.20 and 2.06-hr, respectively, and we identify an orbital period of 2.11-hr. The positive superhumps have a maximum amplitude of \~{}0.25-mag, the negative superhumps a maximum amplitude of \~{}0.8 mag, and the orbital period at quiescence has an amplitude of \~{}0.025 mag. The quality of the Kepler data is such that we can test vigorously the models for accretion disk dynamics that have been emerging in the past several years. The SC data for V344 Lyr are consistent with the model that two physical sources yield positive superhumps: early in the superoutburst, the superhump signal is generated by viscous dissipation within the periodically flexing disk, but late in the superoutburst, the signal is generated as the accretion stream bright spot sweeps around the rim of the non-axisymmetric disk. The disk superhumps are roughly anti-phased with the stream/late superhumps. The V344 Lyr data also reveal negative superhumps arising from accretion onto a tilted disk precessing in the retrograde direction, and suggest that negative superhumps may appear during the decline of DN outbursts. The period of negative superhumps has a positive dP/dt in between outbursts.},

@article{zhang2009symmetric,
abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;We discuss the symmetric smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SSPH) method for generating basis functions for a meshless method. It admits a larger class of kernel functions than some other methods, including the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), the modified smoothed particle hydrodynamics (MSPH), the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM), and the moving least squares (MLS) methods. For finding kernel estimates of derivatives of a function, the SSPH method does not use derivatives of the kernel function while other methods do, instead the SSPH method uses basis functions different from those employed to approximate the function. It is shown that the SSPH method and the RKPM give the same value of the kernel estimate of a function but give different values of kernel estimates of derivatives of the function. Results computed for a sine function defined on a one-dimensional domain reveal that the L 2, the H 1 and the H 2 error norms of the kernel estimates of a function computed with the SSPH method are less than those found with the MSPH method. Whereas the L 2 and the H 2 norms of the error in the estimates computed with the SSPH method are less than those with the RKPM, the H 1 norm of the error in the RKPM estimate is slightly less than that found with the SSPH method. The error norms for a sample problem computed with six kernel functions show that their rates of convergence with an increase in the number of uniformly distributed particles are the same and their magnitudes are determined by two coefficients related to the decay rate of the kernel function. The revised super Gauss function has the smallest error norm and is recommended as a kernel function in the SSPH method. We use the revised super Gauss kernel function to find the displacement field in a linear elastic rectangular plate with a circular hole at its centroid and subjected to tensile loads on two opposite edges. Results given by the SSPH and the MSPH methods agree very well with the analytic solution of the problem. However, results computed with the SSPH method have smaller error norms than those obtained from the MSPH method indicating that the former will give a better solution than the latter. The SSPH method is also applied to study wave propagation in a linear elastic bar.},

While a mathematical treatment of the costs and benefits of decisions can predict the optimal strategy in simple settings, more realistic situations (finite populations, non-vanishing mutations rates, communication between agents, and spatial interactions) require agent-based methods where each agent is modeled as an individual, carries its own genes that determine its decisions, and where the evolutionary outcome can only be ascertained by evolving the population of agents forward in time. Here we discuss the use of agent-based methods in evolutionary game theory and contrast standard results to those obtainable by a mathematical treatment. We conclude that agent-based methods can predict evolutionary outcomes where purely mathematical treatments cannot tread, but that mathematics is crucial to validate the computational simulations.},

@article{dilts1999moving1,
abstract = {The Smooth-Particle-Hydrodynamics (SPH) method is derived in a novel manner by means of a Galerkin approximation applied to the Lagrangian equations of continuum mechanics as in the finite-element method. This derivation is modified to replace the SPH interpolant with the Moving-Least-Squares (MLS) interpolant of Lancaster and Saulkaskas, and define a new particle volume which ensures thermodynamic compatibility. A variable-rank modification of the MLS interpolants which retains their desirable summation properties is introduced to remove the singularities that occur when divergent flow reduces the number of neighbours of a particle to less than the minimum required. A surprise benefit of the Galerkin SPH derivation is a theoretical justification of a common ad hoc technique for variable-h SPH. The new MLSPH method is conservative if an anti-symmetric quadrature rule for the stiffness matrix elements can be supplied. In this paper, a simple one-point collocation rule is used to retain similarity with SPH, leading to a non-conservative method. Several examples document how MLSPH renders dramatic improvements due to the linear consistency of its gradients on three canonical difficulties of the SPH method: spurious boundary effects, erroneous rates of strain and rotation and tension instability. Two of these examples are non-linear Lagrangian patch tests with analytic solutions with which MLSPH agrees almost exactly. The examples also show that MLSPH is not absolutely stable if the problems are run to very long times. A linear stability analysis explains both why it is more stable than SPH and not yet absolutely stable and an argument is made that for realistic dynamic problems MLSPH is stable enough. The notion of coherent particles, for which the numerical stability is identical to the physical stability, is introduced. The new method is easily retrofitted into a generic SPH code and some observations on performance are made. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@article{simpson1998time,
abstract = {The energy production time series of our purely hydrodynamic accretion disk simulations display remarkable similarities with the observed light curves of dwarf novae superhumps in general and the AM CVn stars in particular. The superhump period excess as a function of mass ratio agrees well with earlier theoretical and numerical results, and the amplitudes and relative phases of the harmonics in the power spectra agree well with the observations. The morphology of the mean pulse profile appears to be a useful predictor of system mass ratio. Our modified smoothed particle hydrodynamics code time symmetrizes the interparticle forces when individual time steps are used that differ from each other by a power of 2 and advances the internal energy using a very simple method based on fundamental principles that requires the calculation of only a single vector dot product per particle per time step instead of a separate pairwise internal energy equation. Both of these modifications act to increase the stability of the internal energy changes, resulting in a significant reduction in the noise in the energy production time series. The periodicities in our models are primarily the result of changes in the viscous energy production as the disks experience tidal stressing and oscillate between nearly circular and highly distorted shapes over a superhump period. We follow the system in an inertial frame of reference, and the symmetry axis of the disk during peak energy production is aligned roughly perpendicular to the line joining the center of the stars. This axis precesses slowly in the inertial frame on a timescale of \~{}35-75 orbital periods, where the precession period is a function of the system mass ratio. The disks are thickest in the quadrant undergoing the largest radial excursions. This feature is stationary in the slowly precessing frame. The particle trajectories also show quasi-periodic m \~{} 2 vertical oscillations that generally agree with published analytical predictions.},

abstract = {Complex relationships exist between gut contractility and the flow of digesta. We propose here a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics model coupling the flow of luminal content and wall flexure to help investigate these relationships. The model indicates that a zone of muscular relaxation preceding the contraction is an important element for transport. Low pressures in this zone generate positive thrust for low viscosity content. The viscosity of luminal content controls the localization of the flow and the magnitude of the radial pressure gradient and together with contraction amplitude they control the transport rate. For high viscosity content, high lumen occlusion is required for effective propulsion. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {Previous work by the author has shown that the consistency of the SPH method can be improved to acceptable levels by substituting MLS interpolants for SPH interpolants, that the SPH inconsistency drives the tension instability and that imposition of consistency via MLS severely retards tension instability growth. The new method however was not conservative, and made no provision for boundary conditions. Conservation is an essential property in simulations where large localized mass, momentum or energy transfer occurs such as high-velocity impact or explosion modeling. A new locally conservative MLS variant of SPH that naturally incorporates realistic boundary conditions is described. In order to provide for the boundary fluxes one must identify the boundary particles. A new, purely geometric boundary detection technique for assemblies of spherical particles is described. A comparison with SPH on a ball-and-plate impact simulation shows qualitative improvement. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Abramovich1998,
abstract = {We discuss a Bayesian formalism which gives rise to a type of wavelet threshold estimation in nonparametric regression. A prior distribution is imposed on the wavelet coefficients of the unknown response function, designed to capture the sparseness of wavelet expansion that is common to most applications. For the prior specified, the posterior median yields a thresholding procedure. Our prior model for the underlying function can be adjusted to give functions falling in any specific Besov space. We establish a relationship between the hyperparameters of the prior model and the parameters of those Besov spaces within which realizations from the prior will fall. Such a relationship gives insight into the meaning of the Besov space parameters. Moreover, the relationship established makes it possible in principle to incorporate prior knowledge about the function's regularity properties into the prior model for its wavelet coefficients. However, prior knowledge about a function's regularity properties might be difficult to elicit; with this in mind, we propose a standard choice of prior hyperparameters that works well in our examples. Several simulated examples are used to illustrate our method, and comparisons are made with other thresholding methods. We also present an application to a data set that was collected in an anaesthesiological study.},

abstract = {Protoplanetary disks are quasi-steady structures whose evolution and dispersal determine the environment for planet formation. I review the theory of protoplanetary disk evolution and its connection to observations. Substantial progress has been made in elucidating the physics of potential angular momentum transport processes - including self-gravity, magnetorotational instability, baroclinic instabilities, and magnetic braking - and in developing testable models for disk dispersal via photoevaporation. The relative importance of these processes depends upon the initial mass, size and magnetization of the disk, and subsequently on its opacity, ionization state, and external irradiation. Disk dynamics is therefore coupled to star formation, pre-main-sequence stellar evolution, and dust coagulation during the early stages of planet formation, and may vary dramatically from star to star. The importance of validating theoretical models is emphasized, with the key observations being those that probe disk structure on the scales, between 1 AU and 10 AU, where theory is most uncertain.},

At Johns Hopkins University, we have been working since 2000 to develop an engineering tool using this technique. However, there have been some difficulties in taking the model from examples using a small number of particles to more elaborate and better resolved cases. Several improvements that we have implemented are presented here to handle turbulence, the fluid viscosity and density, and a different time-stepping algorithm is used. The final model is shown to be able to model breaking waves on beaches in two and three dimensions, green water overtopping of decks, and wave–structure interaction.},

@article{Ferrari2009,
abstract = {We propose a new robust and accurate SPH scheme, able to track correctly complex three-dimensional non-hydrostatic free surface flows and, even more important, also able to compute an accurate and little oscillatory pressure field. It uses the explicit third order TVD Runge-Kutta scheme in time, following Shu and Osher [Shu C-W, Osher S. Efficient implementation of essentially non-oscillatory shock-capturing schemes. J Comput Phys 1988;89:439-71], together with the new key idea of introducing a monotone upwind flux for the density equation, thus removing any artificial viscosity term. For the discretization of the velocity equation, the non-diffusive central flux has been used. A new flexible approach to impose the boundary conditions at solid walls is also proposed. It can handle any moving rigid body with arbitrarily irregular geometry. It does neither produce oscillations in the fluid pressure in proximity of the interfaces, nor does it have a restrictive impact on the stability condition of the explicit time stepping method, unlike the repellent boundary forces of Monaghan [Monaghan JJ. Simulating free surface flows with SPH. J Comput Phys 1994;110:399-406]. To asses the accuracy of the new SPH scheme, a 3D mesh-convergence study is performed for the strongly deforming free surface in a 3D dam-break and impact-wave test problem providing very good results. Moreover, the parallelization of the new 3D SPH scheme has been carried out using the message passing interface (MPI) standard, together with a dynamic load balancing strategy to improve the computational efficiency of the scheme. Thus, simulations involving millions of particles can be run on modern massively parallel supercomputers, obtaining a very good performance, as confirmed by a speed-up analysis. The 3D applications consist of environmental flow problems, such as dam-break flows and impact flows against a wall. The numerical solutions obtained with our new 3D SPH code have been compared with either experimental results or with other numerical reference solutions, obtaining in all cases a very satisfactory agreement. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the basic Tree + SPH code is presented and analysed, together with an overview on the software architectures. EvoL is a flexible parallel Fortran95 code, specifically designed for simulations of cosmological structure formation on cluster, galactic and sub-galactic scales. EvoL is a fully Lagrangian self-adaptive code, based on the classical Oct-tree and on the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics algorithm. It includes special features such as adaptive softening lengths with correcting extra-terms, and modern formulations of SPH and artificial viscosity. It is designed to be run in parallel on multiple CPUs to optimize the performance and save computational time. We describe the code in detail, and present the results of a number of standard hydrodynamical tests.},

abstract = {Realistically animated fluids can add substantial realism to interactive applications such as virtual surgery simulators or computer games. In this paper we propose an interactive method based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate fluids with free surfaces. The method is an extension of the SPH-based technique by Desbrun to animate highly deformable bodies. We gear the method towards fluid simulation by deriving the force density fields directly from the Navier-Stokes equation and by adding a term to model surface tension effects. In contrast to Eulerian grid-based approaches, the particle-based approach makes mass conservation equations and convection terms dispensable which reduces the complexity of the simulation. In addition, the particles can directly be used to render the surface of the fluid. We propose methods to track and visualize the free surface using point splatting and marching cubes-based surface reconstruction. Our animation method is fast enough to be used in interactive systems and to allow for user interaction with models consisting of up to 5000 particles.},

abstract = {We have simulated the formation of an X-ray cluster in a cold dark matter universe using 12 different codes. The codes span the range of numerical techniques and implementations currently in use, including SPH and grid methods with fixed, deformable or multilevel meshes. The goal of this comparison is to assess the reliability of cosmological gas dynamical simulations of clusters in the simplest astrophysically relevant case, that in which the gas is assumed to be non-radiative. We compare images of the cluster at different epochs, global properties such as mass, temperature and X-ray luminosity, and radial profiles of various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. On the whole, the agreement among the various simulations is gratifying although a number of discrepancies exist. Agreement is best for properties of the dark matter and worst for the total X-ray luminosity. Even in this case, simulations that adequately resolve the core radius of the gas distribution predict total X-ray luminosities that agree to within a factor of two. Other quantities are reproduced to much higher accuracy. For example, the temperature and gas mass fraction within the virial radius agree to about 10\%, and the ratio of specific kinetic to thermal energies of the gas agree to about 5\%. Various factors contribute to the spread in calculated cluster properties, including differences in the internal timing of the simulations. Based on the overall consistency of results, we discuss a number of general properties of the cluster we have modelled.},

As part of this effort, two vertical drop tests were conducted of a 5-ft-diameter composite fuselage section into water. For the first test, the fuselage section was impacted in a baseline configuration without energy absorbers. For the second test, the fuselage section was retrofitted with a composite honeycomb energy absorber. Both tests were conducted at a nominal velocity of 25-ft/s. A detailed finite element model was developed to represent each test article and water impact was simulated using both Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) and Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) approaches in LS-DYNA, a nonlinear, explicit transient dynamic finite element code. Analytical predictions were correlated with experimental data for both test configurations. In addition, studies were performed to evaluate the influence of mesh density on test-analysis correlation.},

After this it explains how to optimize this effectively, using several techniques, including a GPU based approach. Finally, we discuss bottlenecks that one will face when trying to implement a fluid system into a game. As a reference for this we use a game built from scratch that uses fluids as its main gameplay element. A final conclusion is based on the experience of building this game, and a look at industry examples. As is seen in the research and from the industry examples, SPH is still expensive to put into a game, and therefore it is only used in specific instances. However, the great performance results that are obtained by porting the simulation to a current-generation GPU show a bright future.},

abstract = {The analysis of climate data has relied heavily on hypothesis-driven statistical methods, while projections of future climate are based primarily on physics-based computational models. However, in recent years a wealth of new datasets has become available. Therefore, we take a more data-centric approach and propose a unified framework for studying climate, with an aim toward characterizing observed phenomena as well as discovering new knowledge in climate science. Specifically, we posit that complex networks are well suited for both descriptive analysis and predictive modeling tasks. We show that the structural properties of 'climate networks' have useful interpretation within the domain. Further, we extract clusters from these networks and demonstrate their predictive power as climate indices. Our experimental results establish that the network clusters are statistically significantly better predictors than clusters derived using a more traditional clustering approach. Using complex networks as data representation thus enables the unique opportunity for descriptive and predictive modeling to inform each other. 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{Dave1997,
abstract = {We describe PTreeSPH, a gravity treecode combined with an SPH hydrodynamics code designed for massively parallel supercomputers having distributed memory. Our computational algorithm is based on the popular TreeSPH code of Hernquist \& Katz (1989). PTreeSPH utilizes a domain decomposition procedure and a synchronous hypercube communication paradigm to build self-contained subvolumes of the simulation on each processor at every timestep. Computations then proceed in a manner analogous to a serial code. We use the Message Passing Interface (MPI) communications package, making our code easily portable to a variety of parallel systems. PTreeSPH uses individual smoothing lengths and timesteps, with a communication algorithm designed to minimize exchange of information while still providing all information required to accurately perform SPH computations. We have additionally incorporated cosmology, periodic boundary conditions with forces calculated using a quadrupole Ewald summation method, and radiative cooling and heating from a parameterized ionizing background following Katz, Weinberg \& Hernquist (1996). The addition of other physical processes, such as star formation, is straightforward. A cosmological simulation from z=49 to z=2 with 64\^{}3 gas particles and 64\^{}3 dark matter particles requires \~{}6000 node-hours on a Cray T3D, with a communications overhead of \~{}10\% and is load balanced to a \~{}90\% level. When used on the new Cray T3E, this code will be capable of performing cosmological hydrodynamical simulations down to z=0 with \~{}2x10\^{}6 particles, or to z=2 with \~{}10\^{}7 particles, in a reasonable amount of time. Even larger simulations will be practical in situations where the matter is not highly clustered or when periodic boundaries are not required.},

We also describe numerical simulations which give results in agreement with the results of the experiments and enable us to study three-fluid configurations with wider ranges of density than is possible in the laboratory.},

abstract = {Accretion disks around black hole, neutron star, and white dwarf systems are thought to sometimes tilt, retrogradely precess, and produce hump-shaped modulations in light curves that have a period shorter than the orbital period. Although artificially rotating numerically simulated accretion disks out of the orbital plane and around the line of nodes generates these short-period superhumps and retrograde precession of the disk, no numerical code to date has been shown to produce a disk tilt naturally. In this work, we report the first naturally tilted disk in non-magnetic Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) using 3D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Our simulations show that after many hundreds of orbital periods, the disk has tilted on its own and this disk tilt is without the aid of radiation sources or magnetic fields. As the system orbits, the accretion stream strikes the bright spot (which is on the rim of the tilted disk) and flows over and under the disk on different flow paths. These different flow paths suggest the lift force as a source to disk tilt. Our results confirm the disk shape, disk structure, and negative superhump period and support the source to disk tilt, source to retrograde precession, and location associated with X-ray and He II emission from the disk as suggested in previous works. Our results identify the fundamental negative superhump frequency as indicator of disk tilt around the line of nodes.},

abstract = {Flattened, rotating disks of cool dust and gas extending for tens to hundreds of AU are found around almost all low mass stars shortly after their birth. These disks generally persist for several Myr, during which time some material accretes onto the star, some is lost through outflows and photoevaporation, and some condenses into centimeter- and larger-sized bodies or planetesimals. Through observations mainly at infrared through millimeter wavelengths, we can determine how common disks are at different ages, measure basic properties including mass, size, structure, and composition, and follow their varied evolutionary pathways. In this way, we see the first steps toward exoplanet formation and learn about the origins of the Solar System. This review addresses observations of the outer parts, beyond 1 AU, of protoplanetary disks with a focus on recent infrared and (sub-)millimeter results and an eye to the promise of new facilities in the immediate future.},

abstract = {Femoroplasty is a potential preventive treatment for osteoporotic hip fractures. It involves augmenting mechanical properties of the femur by injecting Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement. To reduce the risks involved and maximize the outcome, however, the procedure needs to be carefully planned and executed. An important part of the planning system is predicting infiltration of cement into the porous medium of cancellous bone. We used the method of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model the flow of PMMA inside porous media. We modified the standard formulation of SPH to incorporate the extreme viscosities associated with bone cement. Darcy creeping flow of fluids through isotropic porous media was simulated and the results were compared with those reported in the literature. Further validation involved injecting PMMA cement inside porous foam blocks - osteoporotic cancellous bone surrogates - and simulating the injections using our proposed SPH model. Millimeter accuracy was obtained in comparing the simulated and actual cement shapes. Also, strong correlations were found between the simulated and the experimental data of spreading distance (R(2) = 0.86) and normalized pressure (R(2) = 0.90). Results suggest that the proposed model is suitable for use in an osteoporotic femoral augmentation planning framework.},

abstract = {A meshless rheological model is proposed for medical simulation of vascular procedures. Due to the complexity of rheologic models involved in endovascular simulations, delivering a high level of interactivity with realistic biomechanical feedback is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a particle-based rheologic modeling method for virtual catheterisation training applications. The effect of blood rheology has been simulated through a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation of non-Newtonian flow. By modeling vessel wall structure as virtual particles, a pure Lagrange particle formulation for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is purposed for modeling the blood-vessel interaction. We further propose a flow-related thrombus (clot) formation-dissolution model based on our fluid-solid interaction framework. A physics processing API (PhysX) friendly implementation is proposed for incorporating the rheological properties of blood and vessel wall into our framework. Results have demonstrated the feasibility of employing our proposed meshfree framework in simulating blood-vessel interaction and clotting behaviors which are essential to endovascular simulations. Having benefited from the elegant formulation of Lagrangian particle interaction, interactive framerates of the simulation can be maintained under hardware-acceleration. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The principal feature of the method is the use of statistical techniques to recover analytical expressions for the physical variables from a known distribution of fluid elements. The equations of motion take the form of Newtonian equations for particles. Starting with a non-axisymmetric distribution of approximately 80 particles in three dimensions, the method is found to reproduce the structure of uniformly rotating and magnetic polytropes to within a few per cent. The method may be easily extended to deal with more complicated physical models.},

For low computational costs per simulation step, efficient parallel neighbourhood queries are proposed and compared. To further minimize the computing time for entire simulation sequences, strategies for maximizing the time step and the respective consequences for parallel implementations are investigated. The presented experiments illustrate that the parallel framework can efficiently compute large numbers of time steps for large scenarios. In the context of neighbourhood queries, the paper presents optimizations for two efficient instances of uniform grids, that is, spatial hashing and index sort. For implementations on parallel architectures with shared memory, the paper discusses techniques with improved cache-hit rate and reduced memory transfer. The performance of the parallel implementations of both optimized data structures is compared. The proposed solutions focus on systems with multiple CPUs. Benefits and challenges of potential GPU implementations are only briefly discussed.},

@article{Kass1996,
abstract = {Subjectivism has become the dominant philosophical foundation for Bayesian inference. Yet in practice, most Bayesian analyses are performed with so-called "noninformative" priors, that is, priors constructed by some formal rule. We review the plethora of techniques for constructing such priors and discuss some of the practical and philosophical issues that arise when they are used. We give special emphasis to Jeffreys's rules and discuss the evolution of his viewpoint about the interpretation of priors, away from unique representation of ignorance toward the notion that they should be chosen by convention. We conclude that the problems raised by the research on priors chosen by formal rules are serious and may not be dismissed lightly: When sample sizes are small (relative to the number of parameters being estimated), it is dangerous to put faith in any "default" solution; but when asymptotics take over, Jeffreys's rules and their variants remain reasonable choices. We also provide an annotated bibliography.},

Artificial viscosity is added to these equations to handle shocks. In this paper we show how the equations may be formulated using the specific energy equation instead of the thermal energy equation. The resulting equations are very similar to the equations constructed for Riemann solutions of compressible gas dynamics. In particular the artificial viscosity is analogous to terms constructed from signal velocities and jumps in variables across characteristics. When applied to shock tubes, blast waves, wall shocks, and the Roberts and Sjogreen problems the new equations ̈ give very good results. They also provide the basis for the general- ization of SPH to relativistic flows.},

abstract = {When a jet of a thinning fluid is poured over a perpendicular surface covered with the same fluid, under certain circumstances it is observed that a small jet seems to bounce out of the surface very close to the incident jet. This phenomenon was first described by Kaye in 1963. In this work, the same type of fluid was used but the surface of incidence was inclined between 10 and 45 degrees. To better visualize the flow, the fluid was seeded with metallic flakes and illuminated with a sheet of light. The speed of the incident jet was kept constant. For each angle of incidence several videos at 240 frames per second were captured. It was observed that initially, a column of the falling liquid is formed. When the column breaks down, a jet comes out of it. The length of contact between the surface and the jet gets longer as the angle of inclination is increased. A critical angle \$\$ $\backslash$theta c \$\$ was found for which the terminal speed is larger than the falling speed of the incident jet. This cannot be explained by any of the mathematical models that have been proposed. The thinning characteristic of the fluid is not taken into account in any of the models.},

It is noted that disk modeling is in some sense more an art than a science, and since a steady disk can be constructed for almost any combination of viscosity and radiation processes, the possibilities are almost endless. Conversely, it is likely that more can be learned about the properties of accretion disks in astrophysics by observation and subsequent modeling than by pure theorizing.},

abstract = {Numerical techniques are described for three-dimensional fluid systems in the absence of self-gravity using the Lagrangian method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). In particular, we present an efficient method for locating nearest neighbors that uses an ancillary Eulerian grid and conserves memory by partitioning the computational space into manageable layers. Further savings in both memory and computational time are achieved by using interparticle distances that are discretized with respect to small integral increments of the smoothing length. We also present a time integration algorithm using multiple time steps which guarantees that all particles are always synchronous in phase space to a least first-order accuracy with respect to the individual time steps. These techniques are used to simulate an accretion disk in a low mass ratio (M2/M1 = 0.08) binary system with the ideal gas law, low adiabatic gamma ($\gamma$ = 1.01), and excluding radiation effects and magnetic fields. The results agree qualitatively with the Shukura-Sunyaev $\alpha$-disk model but overestimate the radial temperature profile by a factor of ˜10, indicating that radiation effects must be included for a complete model.},

abstract = {This review discusses Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) in the astrophysical context, with a focus on inviscid gas dynamics. The particle-based SPH technique allows an intuitive and simple formulation of hydrodynamics that has excellent conservation properties and can be coupled to self-gravity easily and highly accurately. The Lagrangian character of SPH allows it to automatically adjust its resolution to the clumping of matter, a property that makes the scheme ideal for many applications in astrophysics, where often a large dynamic range in density is encountered. We discuss the derivation of the basic SPH equations in their modern formulation, and give an overview about extensions of SPH developed to treat physics such as radiative transfer, thermal conduction, relativistic dynamics or magnetic fields. We also briefly describe some of the most important applications areas of SPH in astrophysical research. Finally, we provide a critical discussion of the accuracy of SPH for different hydrodynamical problems, including measurements of its convergence rate for important classes of problems.},

During the last decade, sky surveys across the electromagnetic spectrum have collected hundreds of terabytes of astronomical data for hundreds of millions of sources. Over the next decade, the data volume will enter the petabyte domain, and provide accurate measurements for billions of sources. Astronomy and physics students are not traditionally trained to handle such voluminous and complex data sets. In this paper we describe astroML; an initiative, based on python and scikit-learn, to develop a compendium of machine learning tools designed to address the statistical needs of the next generation of students and astronomical surveys.

abstract = {We present an overview of how the arterial fluid mechanics problems can be modeled with the stabilized space–time fluid–structure interaction (SSTFSI) technique developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM). The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

abstract = {A century ago, in 1911 and 1913, Plummer and then Reynolds introduced their models to describe the radial distribution of stars in `nebulae'. This article reviews the progress since then, providing both an historical perspective and a contemporary review of the stellar structure of bulges, discs and elliptical galaxies. The quantification of galaxy nuclei, such as central mass deficits and excess nuclear light, plus the structure of dark matter halos and cD galaxy envelopes, are discussed. Issues pertaining to spiral galaxies including dust, bulge-to-disc ratios, bulgeless galaxies, bars and the identification of pseudobulges are also reviewed. An array of modern scaling relations involving sizes, luminosities, surface brightnesses and stellar concentrations are presented, many of which are shown to be curved. These 'redshift zero' relations not only quantify the behavior and nature of galaxies in the Universe today, but are the modern benchmark for evolutionary studies of galaxies, whether based on observations, N-body-simulations or semi-analytical modelling. For example, it is shown that some of the recently discovered compact elliptical galaxies at 1.5 < z < 2.5 may be the bulges of modern disc galaxies.},

abstract = {Asynchronous stochastic systems are abundant in the real world. Examples include queuing systems, tele- phone exchanges, and computer networks. Yet, little attention has been given to such systems in the model checking and planning literature, at least not without making limiting and often unrealistic assumptions re- garding the dynamics of the systems. The most common assumption is that of history-independence: the Markov assumption. In this thesis, we consider the problems of verification and planning for stochastic pro- cesses with asynchronous events, without relying on the Markov assumption. We establish the foundation for statistical probabilistic model checking, an approach to probabilistic model checking based on hypothe- sis testing and simulation. We demonstrate that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art numerical solution methods for probabilistic model checking. While the verification result can be guaranteed only with some probability of error, we can set this error bound arbitrarily low (at the cost of efficiency). Our contribution in planning consists of a formalism, the generalized semi-Markov decision process (GSMDP), for planning with asynchronous stochastic events. We consider both goal directed and decision theoretic planning. In the former case, we rely on statistical model checking to verify plans, and use the simulation traces to guide plan repair. In the latter case, we present the use of phase-type distributions to approximate a GSMDPwith a continuous-time MDP,which can then be solved using existing techniques. We demonstrate that the introduction of phases permits us to take history into account when making action choices, and this can result in policies of higher quality than we would get if we ignored history dependence.},

abstract = {This paper presents a two-dimensional (2D) particle-based model for the red blood cell, and uses it to compute cell deformation in simple shear and pressure-driven flows. The cell membrane is replaced by a set of discrete particles connected by nonlinear springs; the spring law enforces conservation of the membrane area to a high accuracy. In addition, a linear bending elasticity is implemented using the deviation of the local curvature from the innate curvature of the biconcave shape of a resting red blood cell. The cytoplasm and the external liquid are modeled as homogeneous Newtonian fluids, and discretized by particles as in standard smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. Thus, the discrete particles serve not only as a numerical device for solving the partial differential equations, but also as a means for incorporating microscopic physics into the model. Numerically, the fluid flow and membrane deformation are computed, via the particle motion, by a two-step explicit scheme. The model parameters are determined from experimental measurements of cell viscosity and elastic moduli for shear, areal dilatation and bending. In a simple shear flow, the cell typically deforms to an elongated shape, with the membrane and cytoplasm undergoing tank-treading motion. In a Poiseuille flow, the cell develops the characteristic parachute shape. These are consistent with the experimental observations. Comparison with prior computations using continuum models shows quantitative agreement without any fitting parameters, which is taken to be a validation of the particle-based model and the numerical algorithm. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Application of SPH methods in an industrial context is closely linked to the capacity of exploiting the very last and best computational resources available. Indeed SPH involves a computational load that can be significant compared to others and well established numerical methods. Two years ago appeared in the SPHERIC community the first full GPU implementation of a SPH flow solver, based on the high level API CUDA from Nvidia. This pioneering work revealed the high potential of the GPU technology and further works confirmed that hybrid implementations can challenge the classical MPI- or OpenMP-based approaches. However the SPH-ALE method exhibits important peculiarities that require a dedicated approach. The paper thus reports the implementation strategy that has been applied for the different parts of the algorithm, leading to the full GPU implementation of a second order SPH-ALE flow solver, including the management of all types of boundary conditions (solid walls, periodic, symmetry). The impact of numerical models on performance is analyzed. The respective assigned roles to CPU and GPU are also discussed, together with the choice of floating point accuracy. A detailed validation of the GPU implementation versus its CPU counterpart is also shown. The resulting flow solver can achieve speed-ups up to 40 on industrial applications},

@article{rafiee2012comparative,
abstract = {Free-surface flows are of significant interest in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). However, modelling them especially when the free-surface breaks or impacts on solid walls can be challenging for many CFD techniques. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) has been reported as a robust and stable method when applied to these problems. In modelling incompressible flows using the SPH method an equation of state with a large sound speed is typically used. This weakly compressible approach (WCSPH) results in a stiff set of equations with a noisy pressure field and stability issues at high Reynolds number. As a remedy, the incompressible SPH (ISPH) technique was introduced, which uses a pressure projection technique to model incompressibility. Although the pressure field calculated by ISPH is smooth, the stability of the technique is still an open discussion. An alternative approach is to use an acoustic Riemann solver and replace the particle velocities and pressures by pressures and velocities determined from a Riemann solver. This technique is equivalent to the Godunov method in Eulerian techniques and so will be called the Godunov SPH method (GSPH). However, since the acoustic Riemann solver is a first order approximation of the Riemann solution, it is highly dissipative and cannot be employed in energetic free-surface flows without modification. In this paper, the GSPH method is modified by using the HLLC (Harten Lax and van Leer-Contact) Riemann solver. The accuracy of the modified GSPH technique is further improved by utilising the MUSCL (Monotone Upstream-centred Schemes for Conservation Laws) scheme with Slope-Limiter. This modified GSPH method along with the WCSPH and ISPH techniques are used to study non-linear sloshing flow. The accuracy, stability and efficiency of the techniques are assessed and the results are compared with experimental data. ?? 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

We compare the two solution techniques when applied to the verification of time-bounded until formulae in the temporal stochastic logic CSL, both theoretically and through empirical evaluation on a set of case studies. Our study differs from most previous comparisons of numerical and statistical approaches in that CSL model checking is a hypothesis testing problem rather than a parameter estimation problem. We can therefore rely on highly efficient sequential acceptance sampling tests, which enables statistical solution techniques to quickly return a result with some uncertainty. We also propose a novel combination of the two solution techniques for verifying CSL queries with nested probabilistic operators.},
